# LED Lighting
A collection of LED scripts for my apartment.

## Stairs
Checks 3 PIR sensors for motion. Non-addressable (analog) RGB
strip fades-in at a user-selected color.

There are two modes, which are governed by an ambient lighting threshold. No more being blinded in the middle of the night.

Rare Event: Roll for a rare event chance once fade-in is completed.
